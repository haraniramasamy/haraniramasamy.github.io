That is the single picture template, avoid blank newlines in the html code.

<div class="photo">
  <img src="/images/gabe1_1078px.jpg"/>
  <p>You are a mad sort.
Because you can always see through the insanity,
Of when I am only mostly there.</p>
</div>



<div class="photo">
  <img src="/images/example3_1027px.jpg"/>
  <p>We roam with painted faces.
But then why are we puzzled,
When it drips into our eyes.</p>
</div>
