# People

When we walk upon the secrets of the city.

<div class="photo">
  <img src="/images/strang2.jpg"/>
  <p>Exhausted and worn out in those worn out ways,
Sometimes I forget that I live just a bus ride away
From the poorest neighborhood in Canada.</p>
</div>

<div class="photo">
  <img src="/images/example3_1027px.jpg"/>
  <p>We roam with painted faces.
Forgetting for a moment until
it drips into our eyes</p>
</div>

<div class="photo">
  <img src="/images/strang4.JPG"/>
  <p>Waiting to be rescued</p>
</div>
